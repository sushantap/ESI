	<h2>Comic book targets children in slums</h2>
	<p>There are no superheroes in this comic book. There is no
		‘slumdog millionaire’ either. There are only messages for children
		living in slums; to stay away from tobacco and alcohol, to know ‘bad
		touch’ and to keep the environment clean, among others. ‘Reach
		out! With Veera and Chera’ — a comic book with seven episodes in
		it, by Loyola College student Vijay Asokan, was released at the
		Outreach Day–2014 celebrations of the college’s department of
		outreach, on Monday. It is a simple strip in the form of an
		interaction between Veera, a Loyola college student who visits the
		slums as part of the outreach programme, and Chera, a child from the
		slum who handles challenges normally faced by children in slums in the
		cities. “Children in slums do not know the serious problems in life.
		That is why the comic strip has been designed. Apart from creating
		awareness on the harmful effects of tobacco and alcohol use, there is
		also an episode explaining child abuse,” says Vijay.</p>
