				<h2>Comic book targets children in slums</h2>
				<p>There are no superheroes in this comic book. There is no
					âslumdog millionaireâ either. There are only messages for
					children living in slums; to stay away from tobacco and alcohol, to
					know âbad touchâ and to keep the environment clean, among
					others. âReach out! With Veera and Cheraâ â a comic book with
					seven episodes in it, by Loyola College student Vijay Asokan, was
					released at the Outreach Dayâ2014 celebrations of the collegeâs
					department of outreach, on Monday. It is a simple strip in the form
					of an interaction between Veera, a Loyola college student who
					visits the slums as part of the outreach programme, and Chera, a
					child from the slum who handles challenges normally faced by
					children in slums in the cities. âChildren in slums do not know
					the serious problems in life. That is why the comic strip has been
					designed. Apart from creating awareness on the harmful effects of
					tobacco and alcohol use, there is also an episode explaining child
					abuse,â says Vijay.</p>
